        <p>The Nun movies one and two were indeed the best horror films 
        I've watched to date. Full of suspense, terror, and mystery. 
        I'm a fan of movies like these.</p>
        <br/>

        <a href="https://www.netflix.com/br-en/title/80210920?source=35" target="_blank"><h3>The Mother ‧ Action/Thriller ‧</h3></a>
        <p>The movie 'The Mother' featuring Jennifer Lopez was truly 
        one of the best films I've seen recently. It's packed with emotion,
        drama, and a captivating storyline. I'm a fan of movies that delve
        into complex characters and relationships, and this film did not 
        disappoint.</p>

        <a href="https://www.netflix.com/br-en/title/81038963?source=35" target="_blank"><h3>The Old Guard ‧ Action/Fantasy ‧ </h3></a>
        <p>The Old Guard" was an absolute thrill ride from start to finish.
        Charlize Theron's portrayal of Andy and the dynamic ensemble cast
        brought depth and intensity to their immortal characters.
        The film's blend of action, fantasy, and drama was masterfully
        executed, keeping me glued to the screen throughout. 
        It's rare to find a movie that combines such gripping fight 
        sequences with a thought-provoking narrative, making 
        "The Old Guard" a standout in the genre and a personal
        favorite of mine.</p>
